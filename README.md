## LiveTrack - Problem Statement

Location of our loved ones and devices seem to be a great challenge in today's world of theft, kidnapping and abuduction
We also need data on our location at particular periods or dates which is often inaccessible

## LiveTrack - Proposed Solution
We provide a real time location tracking service via mobile devices and smart watches which and also offer an in-app accident detector 
with ability to help report emergencies. The app works based on an alogorithm whicj=h makes its calculation from acceleration readings from device's 
accelerometer and uses in-device gps for location tracking

## Our Stack
- Android(Java)
